Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?
Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?

We chilling it's a vibe
She on me, she sweet, she fine
Two-tone hair, and two kind eyes
Smart with money, me love, me like
I don't like contact
Except hers
She don't beg for bags
Vintage with the purse
Makes love easy
Takes off hurt
I know I get down
It could be way worse
I'm bipolar
Her hair two tone
She take notes
Other girls take loans
She stay low
Others want they own show
I act macho
But she sees, she knows
I don't make posts
But why it gotta be public?
She a solo act, yeah
She real independent with it
For me, same goes
Both of us too intelligent
But I hate love songs
So the chorus irrelevant


Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?
Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?

I don't like to talk
Don't like the drama
Don't like the ops
Socially off
But both of us hot
Weirdos, huh
But still at the top
4'9'' but her money taller
6'3'' makes me a baller
She got jokes and a wallet
Her number had to call it
So odd, I never was a faller
But man, just watch shawty walk
See the outfit pop
Money dropped on the watch
She act a li'l posh but
Who got what she got?
Yeah, she her own boss got the
Key to winning on lock
Woah, she hot and cold
Sold, she got my soul
On hold, I fold
Who better than her?
No one
How the hook go?


Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?
Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?

You are always there for me
Never a second I don't appreciate it
I fail to convey it
I want this forever
Not a romantic
You are always there for me
Never a second I don't appreciate it
I fail to convey it
I want this forever
Not a romantic

Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?
Cutthroat, heading straight for the neck
Concrete graves, meet a steel toe end
All I see is red, all I see is red
Ask who bled? Who dead? Who next?
